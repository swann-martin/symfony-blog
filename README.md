# symfony-blog

This practical work was made to illustrate the course in Symfony and was part of the [Webforce3 Web School Training](https://www.wf3.fr/).
The aim was to make a blog. The user should be able to post, edit and delete messages but only his/hers. We could not use console:make:crud to create all the routes and methods.
